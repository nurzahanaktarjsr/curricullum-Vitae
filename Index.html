	The term curriculum refers to the lessons and academic content taught in a
	school or in   program. In dictionaries, curriculum is often defined as the courses offered by a school, but it is rarely
	used in such a general sense in schools. 
	
	Depending on how broadly educators define or employ the term, curriculum typically refers to the knowledge and skills students
	are expected to learn, which includes the learning standards or learning objectives they are expected to meet; the units and lessons that

	teachers teach; the assignments and projects given to students; the books, materials, videos, presentations, and readings used in a course; and the tests, assessments, and other methods used to evaluate student learning.
	
	An individual teacherâ€™s curriculum, for example, would be the specific learning standards, lessons, assignments, and materials 
	used to organize and teach a particular course.</pre>
